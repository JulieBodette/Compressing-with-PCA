# Compressing-with-PCA
use PCA on mnist dataset, see how long it takes to train and how accurate it is
#Load the MNIST dataset and split it into a training and test set
#training = 60,000 test =10,000

#train a random forest classifier on the dataset and time how long it takes

#evaluate the random forest classifier on the test set (how accurate is it?)

#use PCA to redcue the dataset's dimensionality, with explained variance ratio of 95%

#train a new Random Forest classsifier on the reduced dataset and see how long it takes

#evaluate the random forest classifier on the reduced dataset (how acc
